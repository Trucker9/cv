                  <li>
                    Increased Lighthouse Score by ~15 with practices like
                    extracting and adding critical CSS to index.html (INP/FID),
                    creating styled component CSS files at build time,
                    customizing chunk sizes in Webpack & Rspack, and lazy
                    loading all components via a loadable utility (TBT).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Added SSR in React As requested by the Marketing team, for
                    certain pages for the Googlebot user agent to optimize SEO.
                    This involved fetching data on the server and then hydrating
                    the Redux store on the client.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Used event-driven architecture to design a listener
                    component for dispatched custom events, sending them to
                    Elastic APM-RUM during browser idle time. This reduced
                    clutter in the React code, utilized idle time, and freed up
                    the main thread.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Improved the crash-free rate by 0.8% (from 99.1% to 99.9%)
                    by replacing Elastic APM-RUM with Sentry and configuring it
                    to send alerts to the team when an issue regresses in
                    different builds.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Implemented Continuous Testing by collaborating with a
                    professional test engineer to extract user actions, create
                    test scenarios by applying actions in sequence, covering
                    edge cases, and creating an E2E testing project using
                    Playwright. This project was then deployed to run after each
                    build in the CI to check the release for potential bugs.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Used the Design for Manufacturability (DFM) principle to
                    communicate with designers in order to stay aligned and
                    deliver a suitable design system that can be used by other
                    developers.

                  <li>
                    Utilized Orval to organize API data and reduced optional
                    chaining in the code by collecting Swagger documentation,
                    even for old APIs, from backend developers and organizing
                    them for input into Orval to generate fully-typed React
                    Query hooks as output.

                    Increased Lighthouse performance scores of several company
                    applications by approximately 25–40 points through a range
                    of optimization techniques—ranging from simple fixes like
                    setting fixed dimensions for banners to improve CLS, to
                    advanced strategies such as splitting heavy charts and table
                    data into chunks (each taking ≤50ms to process) and
                    processing them using requestIdleCallback, or leveraging
                    service workers and offloading work from the main thread
                    using Comlink where possible.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Enhanced the performance & UX on the MyPishro platform by:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Identifying unnecessary re-renders using React DevTools
                        and implementing memoization techniques, along with the
                        useCallback hook, to significantly reduce re-renders in
                        large stock market tables and charts.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Uploading assets to MinIO and customizing the
                        cache-control HTTP header for images and icons that
                        rarely change. Additionally, I optimized bundle size by
                        splitting large chunks into smaller ones, addressing
                        issues caused by the bulky graph and table packages used
                        in the stock market projects.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Implemented a monorepo & atomic design system for all React
                    applications to ensure consistency across company projects.
                    Used npm/changesets to version the UI packages and publish
                    them to GitLab for use by other developers.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Found the cause of 1000 unexpected user exits by
                    implementing a custom RUM (Real User Monitoring) system that
                    tracked client-side errors and stored them in MongoDB.
                    Discovered that some chart libraries were failing under
                    heavy load inputted by stock exchange core.

                    Solely designed and developed PishrunFund end-to-end
                    investment platforms using Next.js 14, handling both
                    frontend and backend. Used MongoDB, cached frequently
                    requested charts in Redis, and used MinIO for user file
                    uploads. Containerized the entire application with Docker to
                    enable single-command deployment in CI using GitLab’s DID
                    method.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Solely Designed and developed the PishroBroker company
                    website using Next.js 13's new App Router shortly after its
                    release. Implemented SSG for news pages, RSC and Server
                    Actions and Mutations for interactive pages and sign-up
                    functionality, ISR for stock tables and chart updates, and
                    SSG for static pages such as company branches.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Reduced friction between developers and non-technical
                    stakeholders by implementing Server-Driven Design (SDD) in
                    the MyPishro project. Stakeholders could update website
                    sections via a simple dashboard connected to a NestJS
                    backend, which returned JSON indicating which atomic design
                    molecule to render. The system was scalable across all
                    company projects thanks to a shared monorepo design system.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Maintained a real-time trading platform built with Vue 3 for
                    enhanced performance. Integrated the legacy stock exchange
                    core system and live data using LightstreamerJS, updated
                    stock prices via WebSocket, enabled buy/sell orders, and
                    used Framer Motion to enhance UX with smooth animations.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Added service worker and caching using Workbox for PWA
                    offline support. Used Ionic and Capacitor to generate
                    Android (APK) and iOS (IPA) builds, enabling users to access
                    app analytics features without an internet connection.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Revived a previously unusable React app that was plagued by
                    buggy state management. Leveraged the atomic nature of Jotai
                    to gradually replace parts of the Redux store, eventually
                    removing it entirely.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Defined a coding convention with the help of other
                    developers and Airbnb’s code style guide. Created ESLint and
                    Stylelint configurations, along with an EditorConfig file,
                    to ensure all company projects follow consistent rules.

                  <li>
                    Improved and maintained the front end of a legacy PHP
