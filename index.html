                    (from ~60 to ~75) by implementing critical CSS inlining
                    (optimizing INP/FID), generating styled-component CSS files

                    This initiative significantly decluttered React components,
                    optimized resource utilization, and preserved main thread

                    collaboration with a dedicated test engineer. This involved
                    defining critical user flows, developing comprehensive E2E
                    test scenarios with Playwright covering edge cases, and
                    integrating this automated testing suite into the CI/CD

                    at-risk user segments (identified via Elastic APM-RUM
                    behavioral analytics) by designing and implementing a
                    real-time intervention strategy. This involved monitoring

                    spectrum of optimizations, from foundational CLS fixes
                    (e.g., fixed banner dimensions) to advanced strategies like
                    chunking heavy chart/table data (processed under 50ms via

                    <strong>Server-Driven Design (SDD) system</strong> for the
                    MyPishro project, significantly reducing friction between
                    developers and non-technical stakeholders. This enabled
                    content updates via a NestJS backend and a simple dashboard,
                    dynamically rendering atomic design components based on JSON
                    responses, ensuring scalability across projects through the

                    Led the initiative to define and enforce company-wide coding
                    standards, collaborating with developers to establish
                    conventions based on Airbnb’s style guide. Developed and
                    implemented shared ESLint, Stylelint, and EditorConfig
                    configurations to ensure code consistency and quality across
                    all projects.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Worked on a 10-year-old legacy project, replacing a vanilla
                    JS front-end with Vue 3 in a PHP Laravel environment.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Improved and maintained the front end of a legacy PHP
                    project with no framework, enhancing my core JavaScript and
                    development skills to implement new features.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Implemented a customer support chat app without using any
                    JavaScript frameworks, handling voice messages and images
                    using vanilla JS and object-oriented programming.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Migrated an old CRM/ORM platform from a minimal front end
                    (built with PHP Yii2) to a full React project. Used antD for
                    faster development.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    Improved my JavaScript skills beyond the company's tech
                    stack during my free time.
